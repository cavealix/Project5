# Project5
Park catalog with OAuth sign in via Facebook and Google

This project is a continuation of the basic catalog project as it adds OAuth2 login via Facebook and Google. Upon login user is redirected to the homepage and is granted access to add new items and edit or delete items they have already created. Users can then logoff and the system clears all information related to their Facebook or Google account.
